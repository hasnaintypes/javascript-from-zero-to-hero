## Project Overview
Build a responsive weather application that fetches real-time weather data from an API and displays current conditions, forecasts, and weather maps.

## Features to Implement
1. ✅ Current weather display
2. ✅ 5-day weather forecast
3. ✅ Location-based weather (geolocation)
4. ✅ Search by city name
5. ✅ Weather icons and animations
6. ✅ Temperature unit conversion (°C/°F)
7. ✅ Favorite locations
8. ✅ Weather alerts and notifications
9. ✅ Responsive design
10. ✅ Offline support with cached data

## Technical Requirements
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- OpenWeatherMap API integration
- Geolocation API
- Local storage for favorites and settings
- Responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Error handling for API failures
- Loading states and animations

## API Setup
1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Get your free API key
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual key
