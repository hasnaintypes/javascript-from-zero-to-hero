## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Consistency is Key**: Even 30 minutes daily is better than 3 hours once a week
2. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on the underlying patterns and principles
3. **Practice Variations**: Try different approaches to the same problem
4. **Time Yourself**: Build speed gradually while maintaining accuracy
5. **Explain Your Solutions**: Teaching others reinforces your understanding
6. **Review Regularly**: Revisit previous challenges to reinforce learning
7. **Stay Motivated**: Celebrate small wins and track your progress

## 🆘 When You're Stuck

1. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide complex problems into smaller parts
2. **Draw It Out**: Visualize the problem with diagrams or examples
3. **Start Simple**: Implement a brute force solution first, then optimize
4. **Use Debugger**: Step through your code to understand the flow
5. **Seek Help**: Use online resources, but try to understand, not copy
6. **Take Breaks**: Sometimes stepping away helps you see the solution
7. **Practice Similar Problems**: Build pattern recognition through repetition
