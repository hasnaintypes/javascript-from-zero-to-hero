- Data types and type coercion
- Functions and closures
- Objects and prototypes
- Arrays and array methods

### 2. Advanced JavaScript
- Asynchronous programming
- Event loop and callbacks
- Promises and async/await
- ES6+ features
- Module systems

### 3. DOM and Browser APIs
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Browser storage
- Fetch API and AJAX

### 4. Common Coding Challenges
- Algorithm problems
- Data structure implementations
- Problem-solving patterns
- Code optimization

## Interview Question Categories

### Technical Questions
1. **Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`**
2. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
3. **How does the event loop work?**
4. **What are closures and how do they work?**
5. **Explain prototypal inheritance**

### Coding Challenges
1. **Implement a debounce function**
2. **Reverse a string without using built-in methods**
3. **Find the largest number in an array**
4. **Implement a simple promise**
5. **Create a function to flatten nested arrays**

### Practical Scenarios
1. **How would you optimize a slow-loading webpage?**
2. **Explain how you would handle errors in a large application**
3. **Describe your approach to testing JavaScript code**
4. **How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility?**

## Preparation Strategy
1. **Study Core Concepts**: Master JavaScript fundamentals
2. **Practice Coding**: Solve problems daily
3. **Build Projects**: Create portfolio pieces
4. **Mock Interviews**: Practice explaining your code
5. **Stay Updated**: Learn about new JavaScript features

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not understanding `this` binding
- Confusing `==` and `===`
- Misunderstanding asynchronous code
- Poor error handling
- Not considering edge cases
